# 1. given a string, call get_frequencies to get a dictionary of letters and their frequencies
# 2. use a HuffmanNode class on each letter in the dictionary and insert all of them into a min-heap
# 3. take out the two smallest HuffmanNodes and combine those into one HuffmanNode - use a special character not present in the string
# 4. insert the new node into the heap
# 5. repeat steps 3 and 4 until only one node remains, which is the root of the Huffman tree
